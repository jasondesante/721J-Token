# Metadata Templates

Inspired by other metadata templates, but modified a bunch.

List of inspiration

There are lots of additions in this metadata and some close similarities but distinct differences from the inspiring music metadata standard template research.
An example is these metadata files use exclusively snake case, where I've seen others mix camel case and snake case into the same file.  
I think it is important to try to figure out a music nft metadata standard that is most compatible with all nfts, which is why I went with snake case because it is in line with the OpenSea metadata standards.
